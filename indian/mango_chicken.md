# Mango Chicken

Nice comfort food! 

## Ingredients

* Coconut oil
* 2 red peppers
* 2 yellow onions
* 30 g (net) ginger
* 30 g (net) garlic
* Spice mix
    * 60-80 g yellow curry paste
    * 8 g coriander powder
    * 8 g yellow curry powder
    * 2 g cumin powder
    * 1 g garam masala
* 1200 g frozen mango
* 500 ml coconut milk
* 500 ml coconut cream
* 1200 g chicken thighs
* 3-4 lime leaves
* Fish sauce / salt

## Preparation

* Purée the ginger and garlic
* Coarsely chop the onion and peppers
* Weigh up the spice mix
* Defrost the mango
* Cut the chicken thighs into "bite sizes"
* Get a large enough pot, I use a 7 quart (6.7L) cocotte
* Get your hand mixer ready!

## Instructions

1. Heat a healthy amount (80g?) coconut oil in the pot on medium heat
1. Sauté the chopped peppers and onion until soft/translucent
1. Add the puréed ginger and garlic and sauté for a few minutes
1. Add the spice mix and sauté for some more minutes
1. Add the mango and... sauté!
1. Add the coconut milk and cream, bring to a boil
1. Boil for 15 minutes and hand mix in the pot until smooooth
1. Add the lime leaves to the pot
1. Simmer for a while more to let taste develop, 1 hour is fine
1. While simmering, brown the chopped chicken thigh pieces in a pan
1. Add the chicken into the pot and keep simmering until chicken is fully cooked
1. Add fish sauce (or salt) to taste
1. Before serving, fish out the lime leaves

## Tips

* You can mix 3/4 of the mango into the sauce, and add the rest of the mango to the pot after hand mixing if you want mango bites in the served dish.

## Alternative ingredients

* Use 1 fennel instead of the yellow onion if you are onion intolerant. Just use the "white meaty part".
* Use chicken breast instead of thighs if you want lower fat content.
* Replace coconut cream with coconut milk to reduce fat content.
