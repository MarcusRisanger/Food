# Ragù alla Bolognese

The traditional comfort food that "everyone" knows. This recipe doesn't use any beef stock. There is enough moisture in the ingredients, so with a good pot with a heavy lid you can let it simmer for hours without going dry.

This recipe is quite simple since you don't need to multitask. You make soffritto, you brown the meats, you put everything together and you wait!

## Ingredients

* Olive oil
* Carrots (4-6)
* Yellow onion (2-3)
* Celery (4-6 stalks)
* 1000 g minced beef
* 500 g minced pork
* 300 g pancetta
* 90 g tomato paste
* 1200 g chopped tomatoes (e.g. [Mutti Polpa])
* Fruity red wine (e.g. [Baffo Rosso])
* 50 g Dairy butter
* Salt

## Preparation

* Finely chop the carrots, yellow onions and celery
* Dice the pancetta if not already diced
* Get a large enough pot, I use a 7 quart (6.7L) cocotte

## Instructions

1. Heat the pot to medium heat and add pancetta
1. Cook until the fat renders and it goldens
1. Use a slotted spoon to fish out the pancetta, leave the fat!
1. In the pancetta fat, sauté the carrots, yellow onion and celery until translucent
    * If it gets too dry, or sticks in the bottom, add olive oil!
1. Turn down the heat to low and re-add the pancetta to the pot 
1. In a pan, heat olive oil on high heat
1. Little by little, sear the minced meat
    * Don't overcrowd the pan, do 2-300 grams per "batch"
    * Be brave, let it brown!
    * After browning, chop the browned meat in the pan, but not for too long, retain the moisture in the meat!
    * Make a "hole" in the soffritto in the pan and transfer the meat into this hole
    * Keep on "chopping", to avoid large clumps of meat
1. Give the tomato paste a sear in the pan and transfer to the pot, give the pot a good stir
1. Deglaze the pan with 0.2-0.3 L of red wine, pour into the pot after the alcohol has boiled off
1. Add the chopped tomatoes into the pot
1. Turn up the heat to get the whole pot to a low boil 
1. Pop in the dairy butter
1. Turn down to low heat and simmer with the lid on for as long as you have time for, but ideally at least 3-4 hours for the tastes to develop properly
    * If the ragù looks a bit dry over time, consider adding some more wine! (I usually use half a bottle in total)
    * If the ragù is too runny, let it simmer with the lid off
    * Note that it takes longer to boil off excess than to add too much!
1. Before serving, stir in a ladle of pasta water
1. Salt to taste
    * In my experience, if the ragù tastes unexpectedly "watery", it just needs more salt
1. Serve with tagliatelle, **never** with spaghetti...

## Tips

* Stir in some full fat milk or cream 5-10 minutes before serving
* Some people like to add a pod of star anise in the ragù while simmering - I personally found it to mask the clean taste of the ragù. Your mileage may vary!


## Alternative ingredients

* Use hand minced chuck steak instead of beef mince
* Use hand minced pork neck instead of pork mince
* Use bacon instead of pancetta in a pinch...
* Use 1 fennel instead of the yellow onion if you are onion intolerant.
