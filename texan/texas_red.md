## Ingredients

* 2 kg beef chuck shoulder in 2cm cubes
* 8-10 dried Pasilla, New Mexico or similar chiles- whatever floats your boat
* 250 g slab bacon lardons
* 250 g Spanish onion- small dice
* 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 250 ml brewed coffee
* Six-pack of Shiner Bock beer
* 50g Gebhardts chili powder- taste and adjust as you go with the dry spices
* 40 g ground cumin
* 20 g Mexican oregano
* 40 g masa harina
* 2 L beef stock
* Canola oil
* Salt and pepper

## Method

1. De-seed and de-stem the chiles, heat in a dry skillet over high heat until smoking and bubbled. Cover with one bottle of beer and set aside.
1. Render bacon lardons in a heavy bottomed dutch oven until crisp. Remove and reserve fat.
1. Brown beef over high heat in the rendered fat in batches. Add canola oil as necessary. Do not over fill or meat will steam rather than caramelize. Remove beef and reserve. Leave the fat.
1. Saute onion over low heat until translucent, add garlic at the end.
1. Add meat and bacon back to Dutch oven. Add in chile powder, cumin, Mexican oregano, stock and coffee.
1. Place chiles and one bottle of beer in blender or food processor and pulse until very finely ground. Toss it in.
1. Cover and bring to a very low simmer.
1. Stir occasionally.
1. Sit back and enjoy the remainder of your six-pack of Shiner Bock with a sandwich because this is going to take some time.
1. After an hour, taste and adjust seasoning including adding salt and pepper.
1. Chili is done when the meat is just about to fall apart.
1. Mix masa harina with water or lime juice into a thin paste and stir into the pot.
